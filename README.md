This project demonstrates a Quantum Computing Simulator for Molecular Modeling using PennyLane, Qiskit, and Python. 
The primary goal is to model molecular systems and compute their quantum states and interactions using quantum simulation techniques. 
By leveraging quantum computing, the simulator enables high-precision calculations of molecular structures, providing insights into molecular behavior that are difficult to achieve using classical methods.

Key Features: 
Quantum Circuit Design: A quantum circuit is built to simulate molecular systems using quantum gates.
Hamiltonian Calculation: The molecular Hamiltonian is generated to represent the quantum energy levels and states of the molecule.
Quantum Simulation: PennyLane and Qiskit are used to simulate the quantum states of the molecule, providing insights into the electronic structure and molecular interactions.

Visualization: The probabilities of different quantum states are plotted, giving a detailed view of the quantum behavior of molecules.

Dataset: The project can either use molecular data inputted manually or fetched from the ChemBL or PubChem database. 
The molecules are converted into Hamiltonian representations for quantum simulations.

Example molecules include Hâ‚‚, LiH, or larger organic molecules.
The molecular data includes atomic structures, bond lengths, and angles, which are processed to generate the Hamiltonian.

Model Architecture
The quantum simulation process involves:
Quantum Circuit: The quantum circuit simulates the molecular system using quantum gates such as Pauli-X, Pauli-Z, Hadamard, and CNOT gates.
Hamiltonian Generation: The molecular Hamiltonian is calculated using quantum chemistry algorithms like the Jordan-Wigner Transformation.
Quantum State Evolution: The quantum circuit evolves the quantum state of the system based on the input Hamiltonian.
Measurement: The final state of the quantum system is measured to compute the probability of each possible molecular configuration.
